There is always need for more variations in ground textures! This package contains twenty different types of tileable ground material sets with textures including bump, diffuse and fx maps. The indoor materials have specific alpha maps for better reflection effects. 

The textures are divided in two categories: stone and indoor. The textures come in PNG formats. 
Over 60 predefined materials for instant use and testing show you how the textures can work together. 
All textures come in 1024 x 1024 pixels.

Enjoy the package and THANK YOU for purchasing!
